      <t>
        Deterministic Networking (DetNet) <xref target="RFC8655" format="default"/> has proposed to provide a bounded end-to-end latency
        on top of the network infrastructure, comprising both Layer 2 bridged and Layer 3 routed segments.
        That work encompasses the data plane, OAM, time synchronization, management, control, and security aspects.

      <t>
        Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) Tools are of primary importance
        for IP networks <xref target="RFC7276" format="default"/>.
        DetNet OAM should provide a toolset for fault detection, localization, and performance measurement.
      </t>
      <t>
        This document's primary purpose is to detail the specific requirements of the OAM features recommended to maintain a
   deterministic/reliable network.
        Specifically, it investigates the requirements for a deterministic network, supporting critical flows.
      </t>
      <t>
      	In this document, the term OAM will be used according to its definition specified 
      	in <xref target="RFC6291" format="default"/>.
      	DetNet expects to implement an OAM framework to maintain a real-time
      	view of the network infrastructure, and its ability to respect the Service Level
          Objectives (SLO), such as in-order packet delivery, packet delay, delay variation, and packet loss ratio, assigned to each DetNet flow.
      </t>
      <t>
    This document lists the functional requirements toward OAM for DetNet domain. 
   The list can further be used for gap analysis of available OAM tools to identify
   possible enhancements of existing or whether new OAM tools are required to
   support proactive and on-demand path monitoring and service validation.

      DetNet networks expect to provide communications with predictable low packet delay and packet loss.
      Most critical applications will define an SLO to be required for the DetNet flows it
      generates.
      </t>

	<t>
      To respect strict guarantees, DetNet can use an orchestrator able to monitor and
      maintain the network.
      Typically, a Software-Defined Network controller places DetNet flows
      in the deployed network based on their SLO.
      Thus, resources have to be provisioned a priori for the regular operation of the network. 
      Because OAM is an essential element of the network operation,
      resources, necessary for OAM, need to be accounted for in addition to DetNet flows.
      </t>

	<t>
      Fault-tolerance also assumes that multiple paths could be provisioned
      so that an end-to-end circuit is maintained by adapting to the existing conditions.
      The central controller/orchestrator typically controls the Packet Replication, Elimination, and Ordering Functions (PREOF) on a DetNet device.
      OAM is expected to support monitoring and troubleshooting PREOF on a particular DetNet device and within the DetNet flow.
      </t>

	<t>

	in those scenarios where DetNet solutions involve more than one single central controller.

      <t>
      DetNet networks expect to provide communications with predictable low
packet delay and packet loss. Most critical applications will define
an SLO to be required for the DetNet flows it generates.
</t>
<t>
To respect strict guarantees, DetNet can use an orchestrator able to
monitor and maintain the network. Typically, a Software-Defined
Network (SDN) controller places DetNet flows in the deployed network
based on their SLO. Thus, resources have to be provisioned a
priori for the regular operation of the network. OAM represents the
essential elements of the network operation and necessary for OAM
resources that need to be accounted for to maintain the network
operational.
</t>
<t>
Many legacy OAM tools can be used in DetNet networks, but they are
not able to cover all the aspects of deterministic networking. Fulfilling
strict guarantees is essential for DetNet flows, resulting in
new DetNet specific functionalities that must be covered with OAM.
Filling these gaps is inevitable and needs accurate consideration of
DetNet specifics. Similar to DetNet flows itself, their OAM needs careful
end-to-end engineering as well.
</t>
<t>
For example, appropriate placing of MEPs along the path of a DetNet flow is
not always a trivial task and may require proper design together with the
design of the service component of a given DetNet flow.
</t>
<t>
There are several DetNet specific challenges for OAM. Bounded network
characteristics (e.g., delay, loss) are inseparable service parameters;
therefore, PM is a key topic for DetNet. OAM tools are needed to prove the
SLO without impacting the DetNet flow characteristics. A further challenge
is the strict resource allocation. Resources used by OAM must be considered
and allocated to avoid disturbing DetNet flow(s).
</t>
<t>
The DetNet Working Group has defined two sub-layers: (1) DetNet
service sub-layer, at which a DetNet service (e.g., service
protection) is provided and (2) DetNet forwarding sub-layer, which
optionally provides resource allocation for DetNet flows over paths
provided by the underlying network. OAM mechanisms exist for the
DetNet forwarding sub-layer, nonetheless, OAM for the service
sub-layer requires new OAM procedures. These new OAM functions
must allow, for example, to recognize/discover DetNet relay
nodes, to get information about their configuration, and to
check their operation or status.
</t>

<t>
DetNet service sub-layer functions using a sequence number. That creates
a challenge for inserting OAM packets in the DetNet flow.
</t>
<t>
Fault tolerance also assumes that multiple paths could be provisioned
to maintain an end-to-end circuit by adapting to the existing conditions.
The central controller/orchestrator typically
controls the Packet Replication, Elimination, and Ordering Functions
(PREOF) on a node. OAM is expected to support monitoring and
troubleshooting PREOF on a particular node and within the domain.
</t>
<t>
Note that distributed controllers can also control PREOF
in those scenarios where DetNet solutions involve more than one single central controller.
</t>
<t>
DetNet forwarding sub-layer is based on legacy technologies and has
a much better coverage regarding OAM. However, the forwarding sub-layer
is terminated at DetNet relay nodes, so the end-to-end OAM state of forwarding
may be created only based on the status of multiple forwarding sub-layer segments
serving a given DetNet flow (e.g., in case of DetNet MPLS, there may be
no end-to-end LSP below the DetNet PW).
</t>
<!--
      <t>
      It is undwerstood that the existing OAM tools broadly used in networks can be used in DetNet domains.
      At the same time, it is expected that addressiing specific DetNet use case, for example,
      PREOF, will require extensions to the existing OAM protocols.

    	purposes.

        <t>
			It is worth noting that the test and data packets MUST follow the same
            path, i.e., the connectivity verification has to be conducted in-band without
            impacting the data traffic.
            <!-- TODO-Greg-
            It is critical for both CC, CV and, in general, active OAM methods. I think it can be listed in the Requirements for OAM in RAW section.

            -->
            Test packets MUST share fate with the monitored data traffic without introducing congestion in normal network conditions.

        <name>Information Collection</name>
        <t>
               Information about the state of the network can be collected using several mechanisms. Some protocols,
              e.g., Simple Network Management Protocol, send queries. 
              Others, e.g., YANG-based data models, generate notifications based on the publish-subscribe method.
              In either way, information is collected and sent to the controller.
        </t>
        <t>
               Also, we can characterize methods of transporting OAM information relative to the path of data.
               For instance, OAM information may be transported in-band or out-of-band relative to the DetNet flow.
               In case of the former, the telemetry information uses resources allocated for the monitored DetNet flow.
               If an in-band method of transporting telemetry is used, the amount of generated information needs
               to be carefully analyzed, and additional resources must be reserved. <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data"/> defines the in-band
               transport mechanism where telemetry information is collected in the data packet on which information is generated.
               Two tracing methods are described - end-to-end, i.e., from the ingress and egress nodes,
               and hop-by-hop, i.e., like end-to-end with additional information from transit nodes.
               <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-direct-export"/> and <xref target="I-D.mirsky-ippm-hybrid-two-step"/> are examples of out-of-band
               telemetry transport. In the former case, information is transported by each node traversed
               by the data packet of the monitored DetNet flow in a specially constructed packet. In the latter,
               information is collected in a sequence of follow-up packets that traverse the same path as the data packet of the monitored DetNet flow.
               In both methods, transport of the telemetry can avoid using resources allocated for the DetNet domain.

   As with all on-path telemetry methods, AMM in a DetNet domain with the IP data plane is natively in-band
   in respect to the monitored DetNet flow. Because the marking is applied to a data flow,
  measured metrics are directly applicable to the DetNet flow. AMM minimizes the additional load on
  the DetNet domain by using nodal collection and computation of performance metrics in combination with
  optionally using out-of-band telemetry collection for further network analysis.

         DetNet aims to enable real-time communications on top of a heterogeneous multi-hop architecture.
         To make correct decisions, the controller needs to know the distribution
         of packet losses/delays for each flow, and each hop of the paths.
         In other words, the average end-to-end statistics are not enough.
         The collected information must be sufficient to allow the controller to predict the worst-case.

         In the face of events that impact the network operation (e.g., link up/down,
         device crash/reboot, flows starting and ending), the DetNet Controller need to perform
         repair and re-optimization actions in order to permanently ensure
         the SLO of all active flows with minimal waste of resources
         The controller MUST be able to continuously retrieve the state of the network,
         to evaluate conditions and trends about the relevance of a reconfiguration, quantifying:
      </t>
      <ul empty="true" spacing="normal">

               the reconfiguration cost: the controller needs to trigger some
               reconfigurations.

          DetNet node towards downstream MEP(s) within the given domain at a particular DetNet sub-layer.
<!--   [Ed.note: This is contradictory to the location of MEP in the given DetNet flow.
  Since MEPs are at the ingress and egress, only these can be OAM instances that terminate a DetNet OAM session.
  That can be addressed by s/node/MEP/.
  Further, an OAM session is tied with the particular DetNet flow as ony in that flow resources reserved for the OAM session.
  The latter can be accomodated by s/given domain/particular DetNet flow/.
  As a result of these updates the requirement reads as follows:
 It MUST be possible to initiate DetNet OAM session from any 
  MEP towards another MEP(s) within particular DetNet flow. Comments?] -->

  reverse direction may be out-of-band. I would remove this requirement since
  it is redundant (and partially contradictory) with the discussion on unidirect. vs. bidirect flows.
