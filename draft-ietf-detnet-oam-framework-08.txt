   Framework of Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OAM) for
                   Deterministic Networking (DetNet)
                   draft-ietf-detnet-oam-framework-08

Abstract

   Deterministic Networking (DetNet), as defined in RFC 8655, is aimed
   to provide a bounded end-to-end latency on top of the network
   infrastructure, comprising both Layer 2 bridged and Layer 3 routed
   segments.  This document's primary purpose is to detail the specific
   requirements of the Operation, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM)
   recommended to maintain a deterministic network.  The document will
   be used in future work that defines the applicability of and
   extension of OAM protocols for a deterministic network.  With the
   implementation of the OAM framework in DetNet, an operator will have
   a real-time view of the network infrastructure regarding the
   network's ability to respect the Service Level Objective, such as
   packet delay, delay variation, and packet loss ratio, assigned to
   each DetNet flow.

Internet-Draft         Framework of OAM for DetNet          January 2023


1.  Introduction

   Deterministic Networking (DetNet) [RFC8655] has proposed to provide a
   bounded end-to-end latency on top of the network infrastructure,
   comprising both Layer 2 bridged and Layer 3 routed segments.  That
   work encompasses the data plane, OAM, time synchronization,
   management, control, and security aspects.

   Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) Tools are of
   primary importance for IP networks [RFC7276].  DetNet OAM should
   provide a toolset for fault detection, localization, and performance
   measurement.

   This document's primary purpose is to detail the specific
   requirements of the OAM features recommended to maintain a
   deterministic/reliable network.  Specifically, it investigates the
   requirements for a deterministic network, supporting critical flows.

   In this document, the term OAM will be used according to its
   definition specified in [RFC6291].  DetNet expects to implement an
   OAM framework to maintain a real-time view of the network
   infrastructure, and its ability to respect the Service Level
   Objectives (SLO), such as in-order packet delivery, packet delay,
   delay variation, and packet loss ratio, assigned to each DetNet flow.

   This document lists the functional requirements toward OAM for DetNet
   domain.  The list can further be used for gap analysis of available
   OAM tools to identify possible enhancements of existing or whether
   new OAM tools are required to support proactive and on-demand path
   monitoring and service validation.

1.1.  Terminology

   This document uses definitions, particularly of a DetNet flow,
   provided in Section 2.1 of [RFC8655].  The following terms are used
   throughout this document as defined below:

   *  DetNet OAM domain: a DetNet network used by the monitored DetNet
      flow.  A DetNet OAM domain (also referred to in this document as
      "OAM domain") may have MEPs on its edge and MIPs within.

   *  DetNet OAM instance: a function that monitors a DetNet flow for
      defects and/or measures its performance metrics.  Within this
      document, a shorter version, OAM instance, is used
      interchangeably.

Internet-Draft         Framework of OAM for DetNet          January 2023


   *  Maintenance End Point (MEP): an OAM instance that is capable of
      generating OAM test packets in the particular sub-layer of the
      DetNet OAM domain.

   *  Maintenance Intermediate Point (MIP): an OAM instance along the
      DetNet flow in the particular sub-layer of the DetNet OAM domain.
      A MIP MAY respond to an OAM message generated by the MEP at its
      sub-layer of the same DetNet OAM domain.

   *  Control and management plane: the control and management planes
      are used to configure and control the network (long-term).
      Relative to a DetNet flow, the control and/or management plane can
      be out-of-band.

   *  Active measurement methods (as defined in [RFC7799]) modify a
      DetNet flow by inserting novel fields, injecting specially
      constructed test packets [RFC2544]).

   *  Passive measurement methods [RFC7799] infer information by
      observing unmodified existing flows.

   *  Hybrid measurement methods [RFC7799] is the combination of
      elements of both active and passive measurement methods.

   *  In-band OAM is an active OAM that is in-band within the monitored
      DetNet OAM domain when it traverses the same set of links and
      interfaces receiving the same QoS and Packet Replication,
      Elimination, and Ordering Functions (PREOF) treatment as the
      monitored DetNet flow.

   *  Out-of-band OAM is an active OAM whose path through the DetNet
      domain is not topologically identical to the path of the monitored
      DetNet flow, or its test packets receive different QoS and/or
      PREOF treatment, or both.

   *  On-path telemetry can be realized as a hybrid OAM method.  The
      origination of the telemetry information is inherently in-band as
      packets in a DetNet flow are used as triggers.  Collection of the
      on-path telemetry information can be performed using in-band or
      out-of-band OAM methods.

   *  PM - Performance Monitoring.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] and [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.  The requirements language is used in
   Section 6 and applies to future implementations of DetNet OAM.

2.  Role of OAM in DetNet

   DetNet networks expect to provide communications with predictable low
   packet delay and packet loss.  Most critical applications will define
   an SLO to be required for the DetNet flows it generates.

   To respect strict guarantees, DetNet can use an orchestrator able to
   monitor and maintain the network.  Typically, a Software-Defined
   Network controller places DetNet flows in the deployed network based
   on their SLO.  Thus, resources have to be provisioned a priori for
   the regular operation of the network.  OAM represents the essential
   elements of the network operation and necessary for OAM resources
   that need to be accounted for to maintain the network operational.

   Many legacy OAM tools can be used in DetNet networks, but they are
   not able to cover all the aspects of deterministic networking.
   Fulfilling strict guarantees is essential for DetNet flows, resulting
   in new DetNet specific functionalities that must be covered with OAM.
   Filling these gaps is inevitable and needs accurate consideration of
   DetNet specifics.  Similar to DetNet flows itself, their OAM needs
   careful end-to-end engineering as well.

   For example, appropriate placing of MEPs along the path of a DetNet
   flow is not always a trivial task and may require proper design
   together with the design of the service component of a given DetNet
   flow.

   There are several DetNet specific challenges for OAM.  Bounded
   network characteristics (e.g., delay, loss) are inseparable service
   parameters; therefore, PM is a key topic for DetNet.  OAM tools are
   needed to prove the SLO without impacting the DetNet flow
   characteristics.  A further challenge is the strict resource
   allocation.  Resources used by OAM must be considered and allocated
   to avoid disturbing DetNet flow(s).

Internet-Draft         Framework of OAM for DetNet          January 2023


   The DetNet Working Group has defined two sub-layers:

      DetNet service sub-layer, at which a DetNet service (e.g., service
      protection) is provided.

      DetNet forwarding sub-layer, which optionally provides resource
      allocation for DetNet flows over paths provided by the underlying
      network.

   OAM mechanisms exist for the DetNet forwarding sub-layer,
   nonetheless, OAM for the service sub-layer requires new OAM
   procedures.  These new OAM functions must allow, for example, to
   recognize/discover DetNet relay nodes, to get information about their
   configuration, and to check their operation or status.

   DetNet service sub-layer functions use a sequence numbers for PREOF.
   That creates a challenge for inserting OAM packets in the DetNet
   flow.

   Fault tolerance also assumes that multiple paths could be provisioned
   to maintain an end-to-end circuit by adapting to the existing
   conditions.  The DetNet Controller Plane, e.g., central controller/
   orchestrator, controls the PREOF on a node.  OAM is expected to
   support monitoring and troubleshooting PREOF on a particular node and
   within the domain.

   Note that a distributed architecture of the DetNet Control Plane can
   also control PREOF in those scenarios where DetNet solutions involve
   more than one single central controller.

   DetNet forwarding sub-layer is based on legacy technologies and has a
   much better coverage regarding OAM.  However, the forwarding sub-
   layer is terminated at DetNet relay nodes, so the end-to-end OAM
   state of forwarding may be created only based on the status of
   multiple forwarding sub-layer segments serving a given DetNet flow
   (e.g., in case of DetNet MPLS, there may be no end-to-end LSP below
   the DetNet PW).

3.  Operation

   OAM features will enable DetNet with robust operation both for
   forwarding and routing purposes.

   It is worth noting that the test and data packets are expected to
   follow the same path, i.e., the connectivity verification has to be
   conducted in-band without impacting the data traffic.  It is expected
   that test packets share fate with the monitored data traffic without
   introducing congestion in normal network conditions.

Internet-Draft         Framework of OAM for DetNet          January 2023


3.1.  Information Collection

   Information about the state of the network can be collected using
   several mechanisms.  Some protocols, e.g., Simple Network Management
   Protocol, send queries.  Others, e.g., YANG-based data models,
   generate notifications based on the publish-subscribe method.  In
   either way, information is collected and sent using the DetNet
   Controller Plane.

   Also, we can characterize methods of transporting OAM information
   relative to the path of data.  For instance, OAM information may be
   transported in-band or out-of-band relative to the DetNet flow.  In
   case of the former, the telemetry information uses resources
   allocated for the monitored DetNet flow.  If an in-band method of
   transporting telemetry is used, the amount of generated information
   needs to be carefully analyzed, and additional resources must be
   reserved.  [RFC9197] defines the in-band transport mechanism where
   telemetry information is collected in the data packet on which
   information is generated.  Two tracing methods are described - end-
   to-end, i.e., from the ingress and egress nodes, and hop-by-hop,
   i.e., like end-to-end with additional information from transit nodes.
   [RFC9326] and [I-D.mirsky-ippm-hybrid-two-step] are examples of out-
   of-band telemetry transport.  In the former case, information is
   transported by each node traversed by the data packet of the
   monitored DetNet flow in a specially constructed packet.  In the
   latter, information is collected in a sequence of follow-up packets
   that traverse the same path as the data packet of the monitored
   DetNet flow.  In both methods, transport of the telemetry can avoid
   using resources allocated for the DetNet domain.

3.2.  Continuity Check

   Continuity check is used to monitor the continuity of a path, i.e.,
   that there exists a way to deliver the packets between two MEP A and
   MEP B.  The continuity check detects a network failure in one
   direction, from the MEP transmitting test packets to the remote
   egress MEP.  Continuity check in a DetNet OAM domain monitors the
   DetNet forwarding sub-layer and thus is not affected by a PREOF that
   operates at the DetNet service sub-layer ([RFC8655].

3.3.  Connectivity Verification

   In addition to the Continuity Check, DetNet solutions have to verify
   the connectivity.  This verification considers additional
   constraints, i.e., the absence of misconnection.  The misconnection
   error state is entered after several consecutive test packets from
   other DetNet flows are received.  The definition of the conditions of
   entry and exit for misconnection error state is outside the scope of

   this document.  Connectivity verification in a DetNet OAM domain
   monitors the DetNet forwarding sub-layer and thus is not affected by
   PREOF that operates at the DetNet service sub-layer ([RFC8655].

3.4.  Route Tracing

   Ping and traceroute are two ubiquitous tools that help localize and
   characterize a failure in the network using echo request/reply
   mechanism.  They help to identify a subset of the list of routers in
   the route.  However, to be predictable, resources are reserved per
   flow in DetNet.  Thus, DetNet needs to define route tracing tools
   able to track the route for a specific flow.  Also, tracing can be
   used for the discovery of the Path Maximum Transmission Unit or
   location of elements of PREOF for the particular route in the DetNet
   domain.

   DetNet is not expected to use Equal-Cost Multipath (ECMP) [RFC8939].
   As the result, DetNet OAM in ECMP environment is outside the scope of
   this document.

3.5.  Fault Verification/Detection

   DetNet expects to operate fault-tolerant networks.  Thus, mechanisms
   able to detect faults before they impact the network performance are
   needed.

   The network has to detect when a fault occurred, i.e., the network
   has deviated from its expected behavior.  Fault detection can be
   based on pro-active OAM protocols like continuity check or on-demand
   like ping.  While the network must report an alarm, the cause may not
   be identified precisely.  For instance, the end-to-end reliability
   has decreased significantly, or a buffer overflow occurs.

3.6.  Fault Localization and Characterization

   An ability to localize the network defect and provide its
   characterization are necessary elements of network operation.

      Fault localization, a process of deducing the location of a
      network failure from a set of observed failure indications, might
      be achieved, for example, by tracing the route of the DetNet flow
      in which the network failure was detected.  Another method of
      fault localization can correlate reports of failures from a set of
      interleaving sessions monitoring path continuity.

Internet-Draft         Framework of OAM for DetNet          January 2023


      Fault characterization is a process of identifying the root cause
      of the problem.  For instance, misconfiguration or malfunction of
      PREOF elements can be the cause of erroneous packet replication or
      extra packets being flooded in the DetNet domain.

3.7.  Use of Hybrid OAM in DetNet

   Hybrid OAM methods are used in performance monitoring and defined in
   [RFC7799] as:

      Hybrid Methods are Methods of Measurement that use a combination
      of Active Methods and Passive Methods.

   A hybrid measurement method may produce metrics as close to passive,
   but it still alters something in a data packet even if that is the
   value of a designated field in the packet encapsulation.  One example
   of such a hybrid measurement method is the Alternate Marking method
   (AMM) described in [RFC8321].  As with all on-path telemetry methods,
   AMM in a DetNet domain with the IP data plane is natively in-band in
   respect to the monitored DetNet flow.  Because the marking is applied
   to a data flow, measured metrics are directly applicable to the
   DetNet flow.  AMM minimizes the additional load on the DetNet domain
   by using nodal collection and computation of performance metrics in
   combination with optionally using out-of-band telemetry collection
   for further network analysis.

4.  Administration

   The ability to expose a collection of metrics to support an operator
   making proper decisions is essential.  Following perfromance metrics
   are useful:

   *  Queuing Delay: the time elapsed between a packet enqueued and its
      transmission to the next hop.

   *  Buffer occupancy: the number of packets present in the buffer, for
      each of the existing flows.

   *  Per a DetNet flow to measure the end-to-end performance for a
      given flow.  Each of the paths has to be isolated in multipath
      routing strategies.

   *  Per path to detect misbehaving path(s) when multiple paths are
      used for the service protection.

   *  Per device to detect misbehaving device, when it relays the
      packets of several flows.

Internet-Draft         Framework of OAM for DetNet          January 2023


4.1.  Collection of metrics

   The optimization of the number of statistics / measurements to
   collected, frequency of collecting using a distributed and/or
   centralized mechanisms is an important operational function.
   Periodic and event-triggered collection information characterizing
   the state of a network is an example of of of mechanisms to achieve
   the optimization.

4.2.  Worst-case metrics

   DetNet aims to enable real-time communications on top of a
   heterogeneous multi-hop architecture.  To make correct decisions, the
   DetNet Controller Plane [RFC8655] needs timely information about
   packet losses/delays for each flow, and each hop of the paths.  In
   other words, just the average end-to-end statistics are not enough.
   The collected information must be sufficient to allow a system to
   predict the worst-case scenario.

5.  Maintenance

   Service protection (provided by the DetNet Service sub-layer) is
   designed to cope with simple network failures and mitigates the
   DetNet Controller Plane's immediate reaction to network events.  In
   the face of events that impact the network operation (e.g., link up/
   down, device crash/reboot, flows starting and ending), the DetNet
   Controller Plane needs to perform repair and re-optimization actions
   in order to permanently ensure the SLO of all active flows with
   minimal waste of resources.  The Controller Plane is expected to be
   able to continuously retrieve the state of the network, to evaluate
   conditions and trends about the relevance of a reconfiguration,
   quantifying:

      the cost of the sub-optimality: resources may not be used
      optimally (e.g., a better path exists).

      the reconfiguration cost: the DetNet Controller Plane needs an
      ability to trigger some reconfigurations.  For this transient
      period, resources may be twice reserved, and control packets have
      to be transmitted.

   Thus, reconfiguration may only be triggered if the gain is
   significant.

5.1.  Replication / Elimination

   When multiple paths are reserved between two MEPs, packet replication
   may be used to introduce redundancy and alleviate transmission errors
   and collisions.  For instance, in Figure 1, the source device S is
   transmitting a packet to devices A and B.


                          ===> (A) => (C) => (E) ===
                        //        \\//   \\//       \\
              source (S)          //\\   //\\         (R) (root)
                        \\       //  \\ //  \\      //
                          ===> (B) => (D) => (F) ===

       Figure 1: Packet Replication: S transmits twice the same data
                         packet, to nodes A and B.

5.2.  Resource Reservation

   Because the quality of service criteria associated with a path may
   degrade, the network has to provision additional resources along the
   path.

6.  Requirements

   According to [RFC8655], DetNet functionality is divided into
   forwarding and service sub-layers.  The DetNet forwarding sub-layer
   includes DetNet transit nodes and may allocate resources for a DetNet
   flow over paths provided by the underlay network.  The DetNet service
   sub-layer includes DetNet relay nodes and provides a DetNet service
   (e.g., service protection).  This section lists general requirements
   for DetNet OAM as well as requirements in each of the DetNet sub-
   layers of a DetNet domain.

   1.   It MUST be possible to initiate a DetNet OAM session from a MEP
        located at a DetNet node towards MEP(s) downstream from that
        DetNet node within the given domain at a particular DetNet sub-
        layer.

   2.   It MUST be possible to initialize a DetNet OAM session from
        using any of DetNet Controller Plane solution, e.g., centralized
        controller.

   3.   DetNet OAM MUST support proactive OAM monitoring and measurement
        methods.

   4.   DetNet OAM MUST support on-demand OAM monitoring and measurement
        methods.

   5.   DetNet OAM MUST support unidirectional OAM methods, continuity
        check, connectivity verification, and performance measurement.

   6.   OAM methods MAY combine in-band monitoring or measurement in the
        forward direction and out-of-bound notification in the reverse
        direction, i.e., towards the ingress MEP.

   7.   DetNet OAM MUST support bi-directional DetNet flows.

   8.   DetNet OAM MAY support bi-directional OAM methods for bi-
        directional DetNet flows.  OAM test packets used for monitoring
        and measurements MUST be in-band in both directions.

   9.   DetNet OAM MUST support proactive monitoring of a DetNet device
        reachability for a given DetNet flow.

   10.  DetNet OAM MUST support hybrid performance measurement methods.

   11.  Calculated performance metrics MUST include but are not limited
        to throughput, packet loss, out of order, delay, and delay
        variation metrics.  [RFC6374] provides detailed information on
        performance measurement and performance metrics.

6.1.  Requirements on OAM for DetNet Forwarding Sub-layer

   1.  DetNet OAM MUST support Path Maximum Transmission Unit discovery.

   2.  DetNet OAM MUST support Remote Defect Indication notification to
       the DetNet OAM instance performing continuity checking.

   3.  DetNet OAM MUST support monitoring levels of resources allocated
       for the particular DetNet flow.  Such resources include but not
       limited to buffer utilization, scheduler transmission calendar.

   4.  DetNet OAM MUST support monitoring any sub-set of paths traversed
       through the DetNet domain by the DetNet flow.

6.2.  Requirements on OAM for DetNet Service Sub-layer

   The OAM functions for the DetNet service sub-layer allow, for
   example, to recognize/discover DetNet relay nodes, to get information
   about their configuration, and to check their operation or status.

   The requirements on OAM for a DetNet relay node are:

   1.  DetNet OAM MUST provide OAM functions for the DetNet service sub-
       layer.

Internet-Draft         Framework of OAM for DetNet          January 2023


   2.  DetNet OAM MUST support the discovery of DetNet relay nodes in a
       DetNet network.

   3.  DetNet OAM MUST support the discovery of Packet Replication,
       Elimination, and Order preservation sub-functions locations in
       the domain.

   4.  DetNet OAM MUST support the collection of the DetNet service sub-
       layer specific (e.g., configuration/operation/status) information
       from DetNet relay nodes.

   5.  DetNet OAM MUST support excercising functionality of Packet
       Replication, Elimination, and Order preservation sub-functions in
       the domain.

   6.  DetNet OAM MUST work for DetNet data planes - MPLS and IP.

   7.  DetNet OAM MUST support defect notification mechanism, like Alarm
       Indication Signal.  Any DetNet relay node within the given DetNet
       flow MAY originate a defect notification addressed to any subset
       of DetNet relay nodes within that flow.

   8.  DetNet OAM MUST be able to measure metrics (e.g. delay) inside a
       collection of OAM sessions, specially for complex DetNet flows,
       with PREOF features.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actionable requirements for IANA.  This section
   can be removed before the publication.

8.  Security Considerations

   This document lists the OAM requirements for a DetNet domain and does
   not raise any security concerns or issues in addition to ones common
   to networking and those specific to a DetNet discussed in Section 9
   of [RFC9055].
