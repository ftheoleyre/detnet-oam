      <t>
        Deterministic Networking (DetNet) <xref target="RFC8655" format="default"/> has proposed to provide a bounded end-to-end latency
        on top of the network infrastructure, comprising both Layer 2 bridged and Layer 3 routed segments.
        That work encompasses the data plane, OAM, time synchronization, management, control, and security aspects.
      </t>
      <t>
        Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) Tools are of primary importance
        for IP networks <xref target="RFC7276" format="default"/>.
        DetNet OAM should provide a toolset for fault detection, localization, and performance measurement.
      </t>
      <t>
        This document's primary purpose is to detail the specific requirements of the OAM features recommended to maintain a
   deterministic/reliable network.
        Specifically, it investigates the requirements for a deterministic network, supporting critical flows.
      </t>
      <t>
      	In this document, the term OAM will be used according to its definition specified 
      	in <xref target="RFC6291" format="default"/>.
      	DetNet expects to implement an OAM framework to maintain a real-time
      	view of the network infrastructure, and its ability to respect the Service Level
          Objectives (SLO), such as in-order packet delivery, packet delay, delay variation, and packet loss ratio, assigned to each DetNet flow.
      </t>
      <t>
    This document lists the functional requirements toward OAM for DetNet domain. 
   The list can further be used for gap analysis of available OAM tools to identify
   possible enhancements of existing or whether new OAM tools are required to
   support proactive and on-demand path monitoring and service validation.

        <t>
            This document uses definitions, particularly of a DetNet flow, provided in Section 2.1 of <xref target="RFC8655"/>.
            The following terms are used throughout this document as defined below:

        <ul spacing="normal">
                  <li>
                    DetNet OAM domain: a DetNet network used by the monitored DetNet flow. A DetNet OAM domain
                    (also referred to in this document as "OAM domain") may have MEPs on its edge and MIPs within.
                   </li>
          <li>
                    DetNet OAM instance: a function that monitors a DetNet flow for defects and/or measures its performance metrics. Within this document,
                    a shorter version, OAM instance, is used interchangeably.
                   </li>
               <li>
                   Maintenance End Point (MEP): an OAM instance that is capable of generating OAM test packets
                   in the particular sub-layer of the DetNet OAM domain.
               </li>
          <li>
                   Maintenance Intermediate Point (MIP): an OAM instance along the DetNet flow  in the particular sub-layer of the DetNet OAM domain.
A MIP MAY respond to an OAM message generated by the MEP at its sub-layer of the same DetNet OAM domain.
               </li>
          <li>
               Control and management plane: the control and management planes are used to configure and control the network (long-term).
               Relative to a DetNet flow, the control and/or management plane can be out-of-band.
                   </li>
          <li>
               Active measurement methods (as defined in <xref target="RFC7799" format="default"/>)
                  modify a DetNet flow by inserting novel fields, injecting specially constructed test packets <xref target="RFC2544" format="default"/>).

          <li>Passive measurement methods <xref target="RFC7799" format="default"/> infer information by observing unmodified existing flows.</li>
          <li>Hybrid measurement methods <xref target="RFC7799" format="default"/> is the combination of elements of both active and passive measurement methods.</li>
          <li>
             In-band OAM is an active OAM that is in-band within the monitored
      DetNet OAM domain when it traverses the same set of links and interfaces
      receiving the same QoS and Packet Replication, Elimination, and Ordering Functions
(PREOF) treatment as the monitored DetNet flow.
</li>
<li>
   Out-of-band OAM is an active OAM whose path through the DetNet domain is not topologically identical to the
   path of the monitored DetNet flow, or its test packets receive different QoS and/or PREOF treatment, or both.
      </li>
      <li>
      On-path telemetry can be realized as a hybrid OAM method. The origination of the telemetry information
      is inherently in-band as packets in a DetNet flow are used as triggers. Collection of the on-path telemetry information
      can be performed using in-band or out-of-band OAM methods.

      <name>Role of OAM in DetNet</name>
      <t>
      DetNet networks expect to provide communications with predictable low
packet delay and packet loss. Most critical applications will define
an SLO to be required for the DetNet flows it generates.
</t>
<t>
To respect strict guarantees, DetNet can use an orchestrator able to
monitor and maintain the network. Typically, a Software-Defined
Network controller places DetNet flows in the deployed network
based on their SLO. Thus, resources have to be provisioned a
priori for the regular operation of the network. OAM represents the
essential elements of the network operation and necessary for OAM
resources that need to be accounted for to maintain the network
operational.
</t>
<t>
Many legacy OAM tools can be used in DetNet networks, but they are
not able to cover all the aspects of deterministic networking. Fulfilling
strict guarantees is essential for DetNet flows, resulting in
new DetNet specific functionalities that must be covered with OAM.
Filling these gaps is inevitable and needs accurate consideration of
DetNet specifics. Similar to DetNet flows itself, their OAM needs careful
end-to-end engineering as well.
</t>
<t>
For example, appropriate placing of MEPs along the path of a DetNet flow is
not always a trivial task and may require proper design together with the
design of the service component of a given DetNet flow.
</t>
<t>
There are several DetNet specific challenges for OAM. Bounded network
characteristics (e.g., delay, loss) are inseparable service parameters;
therefore, PM is a key topic for DetNet. OAM tools are needed to prove the
SLO without impacting the DetNet flow characteristics. A further challenge
is the strict resource allocation. Resources used by OAM must be considered
and allocated to avoid disturbing DetNet flow(s).
</t>
<t>
The DetNet Working Group has defined two sub-layers:
</t>
<ul empty="true" spacing="normal">
<li>
DetNet service sub-layer, at which a DetNet service (e.g., service
protection) is provided.
</li> 
<li>
DetNet forwarding sub-layer, which
optionally provides resource allocation for DetNet flows over paths
provided by the underlying network.
</li>
</ul>
<t>
OAM mechanisms exist for the
DetNet forwarding sub-layer, nonetheless, OAM for the service
sub-layer requires new OAM procedures. These new OAM functions
must allow, for example, to recognize/discover DetNet relay
nodes, to get information about their configuration, and to
check their operation or status.
</t>

<t>
DetNet service sub-layer functions use a sequence numbers for PREOF. That creates
a challenge for inserting OAM packets in the DetNet flow.
</t>
<t>
Fault tolerance also assumes that multiple paths could be provisioned
to maintain an end-to-end circuit by adapting to the existing conditions.
The DetNet Controller Plane, e.g., central controller/orchestrator, controls the PREOF on a node. OAM is expected to support monitoring and
troubleshooting PREOF on a particular node and within the domain.
</t>
<t>
Note that a distributed architecture of the DetNet Control Plane can also control PREOF
in those scenarios where DetNet solutions involve more than one single central controller.
</t>
<t>
DetNet forwarding sub-layer is based on legacy technologies and has
a much better coverage regarding OAM. However, the forwarding sub-layer
is terminated at DetNet relay nodes, so the end-to-end OAM state of forwarding
may be created only based on the status of multiple forwarding sub-layer segments
serving a given DetNet flow (e.g., in case of DetNet MPLS, there may be
no end-to-end LSP below the DetNet PW).
</t>
<!--
      <t>
      It is undwerstood that the existing OAM tools broadly used in networks can be used in DetNet domains.
      At the same time, it is expected that addressiing specific DetNet use case, for example,
      PREOF, will require extensions to the existing OAM protocols.
      </t>

<section numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Operation</name>
      <t>
    	OAM features will enable DetNet with robust operation both for forwarding and routing
    	purposes.
      </t>

        <t>
			It is worth noting that the test and data packets are expected to follow the same
            path, i.e., the connectivity verification has to be conducted in-band without
            impacting the data traffic.
            It is expected that test packets share fate with the monitored data traffic
            without introducing congestion in normal network conditions.
        </t>

    <section numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Information Collection</name>
        <t>
               Information about the state of the network can be collected using several mechanisms. Some protocols,
              e.g., Simple Network Management Protocol, send queries. 
              Others, e.g., YANG-based data models, generate notifications based on the publish-subscribe method.
              In either way, information is collected and sent using the DetNet Controller Plane.
        </t>
        <t>
               Also, we can characterize methods of transporting OAM information relative to the path of data.
               For instance, OAM information may be transported in-band or out-of-band relative to the DetNet flow.
               In case of the former, the telemetry information uses resources allocated for the monitored DetNet flow.
               If an in-band method of transporting telemetry is used, the amount of generated information needs
               to be carefully analyzed, and additional resources must be reserved. <xref target="RFC9197"/> defines the in-band
               transport mechanism where telemetry information is collected in the data packet on which information is generated.
               Two tracing methods are described - end-to-end, i.e., from the ingress and egress nodes,
               and hop-by-hop, i.e., like end-to-end with additional information from transit nodes.
               <xref target="RFC9326"/> and <xref target="I-D.mirsky-ippm-hybrid-two-step"/> are examples of out-of-band
               telemetry transport. In the former case, information is transported by each node traversed
               by the data packet of the monitored DetNet flow in a specially constructed packet. In the latter,
               information is collected in a sequence of follow-up packets that traverse the same path as the data packet of the monitored DetNet flow.
               In both methods, transport of the telemetry can avoid using resources allocated for the DetNet domain.

        <name>Continuity Check</name>
        <t>
			Continuity check is used to monitor the continuity of a path, i.e.,
            that there exists a way to deliver the packets between
            two MEP A and MEP B. The continuity check detects a network failure in one direction,
            from the MEP transmitting test packets to the remote egress MEP. Continuity check in a DetNet OAM domain
           monitors the DetNet forwarding sub-layer and thus is not affected
           by a PREOF that operates at the DetNet service sub-layer (<xref target="RFC8655"/>.

            In addition to the Continuity Check, DetNet solutions have to verify the connectivity.
            This verification considers additional constraints, i.e., the absence of
            misconnection. The misconnection error state is entered after several consecutive test packets
            from other DetNet flows are received. The definition of the conditions of entry and exit for misconnection
            error state is outside the scope of this document. Connectivity verification in a DetNet OAM domain

        <name>Use of Hybrid OAM in DetNet</name>

</t>
        <ul empty="true" spacing="normal">
          <li>Hybrid Methods are Methods of Measurement that use a combination of
   Active Methods and Passive Methods.</li>
        </ul>
        <t>
   A hybrid measurement method may produce metrics as close to passive,
   but it still alters something in a data packet even if that is the value of a 
   designated field in the packet encapsulation. One example of such a hybrid measurement method
   is the Alternate Marking method (AMM) described in <xref target="RFC8321" format="default"/>.
   As with all on-path telemetry methods, AMM in a DetNet domain with the IP data plane is natively in-band
   in respect to the monitored DetNet flow. Because the marking is applied to a data flow,
  measured metrics are directly applicable to the DetNet flow. AMM minimizes the additional load on

         DetNet aims to enable real-time communications on top of a heterogeneous multi-hop architecture.
         To make correct decisions, the DetNet Controller Plane <xref target="RFC8655"/> needs timely information
         about packet losses/delays for each flow, and each hop of the paths.
         In other words, just the average end-to-end statistics are not enough.
         The collected information must be sufficient to allow a system to predict the worst-case scenario.

      Service protection (provided by the DetNet Service sub-layer) is designed
      to cope with simple network failures and mitigates the DetNet Controller Plane's
      immediate reaction to network events. In the face of events that impact the network operation (e.g., link up/down,
         device crash/reboot, flows starting and ending), the DetNet Controller Plane needs to perform
         repair and re-optimization actions in order to permanently ensure
         the SLO of all active flows with minimal waste of resources.
         The Controller Plane is expected to be able to continuously retrieve the state of the network,
         to evaluate conditions and trends about the relevance of a reconfiguration, quantifying:
      </t>
      <ul empty="true" spacing="normal">
        <li> the cost of the sub-optimality: resources may not be used
               optimally (e.g., a better path exists).
            </li>
        <li>
               the reconfiguration cost: the DetNet Controller Plane needs an ability to trigger some reconfigurations.
               For this transient period, resources may be twice reserved, and control packets have to be transmitted.
            </li>
      </ul>

         Thus, reconfiguration may only be triggered if the gain is significant.
