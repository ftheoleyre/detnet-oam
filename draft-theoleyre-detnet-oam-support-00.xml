<section title="Introduction">
    
    <t>
        Deterministic Networking (DetNet) <xref target="RFC8655"/> has proposed to provide a bounded end-to-end latency
        on top of the network infrastructure, comprising both Layer 2 bridged and Layer 3 routed segments.
        Their work encompasses the data plane, OAM, time synchronization, management, control, and security aspects.
    </t>
    
	   
    <t>
        Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) Tools are of primary importance
        for IP networks <xref target="RFC7276"/>.
        It defines a toolset for fault detection and isolation, and for performance measurement.
    </t>
       
    <t>
        The main purpose of this document is to detail the specific requirements of the OAM
        features recommended to construct a predictable communication infrastructure
        on top of a collection of wireless segments.
      	This document describes the benefits, problems, and trade-offs for using OAM in 
    	deterministic networks.
	</t>
    
   <t>
      	In this document, the term OAM will be used according to its definition specified 
      	in <xref target="RFC6291"/>.
      	We expect to implement an OAM framework in detnet networks to maintain a real-time
      	view of the network infrastructure, and its ability to respect the Service Level
          Objectives (SLO), such as delay and reliability, assigned to each data flow.

<!-- INTEREST OF OAM          -->
<section title="Role of OAM in RAW">
	<t>
      detnet networks expect to make the communications reliable and predictable.
      Most critical applications will define an SLO to be required for the data flows it
      generates.
	</t>


	<t>
      To respect strict guarantees, detnet relies on an orchestrator able to monitor and
      maintain the network.
      Typically, a Software Defined Network (SDN) controller is in charge of scheduling the transmissions
      in the deployed network, based on the radio link characteristics, SLO of the flows, the
      number of packets to forward.
      Thus, resources have to be provisioned a priori to handle any defect. 
      OAM represents the core of the over provisioning process, and maintains the network 
      operational by updating the schedule dynamically.
	</t>

<!-- TODO-Greg-
Strictly speaking, PREOF also includes an order preservation. Do you see it as the required element in RAW?
-->

	<t>
      Fault-tolerance also assumes that multiple paths have to be provisioned
      so that an end-to-end circuit keeps on existing whatever the conditions.
      The replication/elimination processes (PREOF) on a node is typically controlled by the
      central controller/orchestrator.
      OAM is in charge of controlling that PREOF is working properly on a node and within the domain.
	</t>

	<t>
       RAW supports both proactive and on-demand troubleshooting.
	</t>
</section>




<!--  OPERATION          -->
<section title="Operation">
	<t>
    	OAM features will enable RAW with robust operation both for forwarding and routing 
    	purposes.
	</t>
    
    <!-- TODO-Greg-
    We can clarify that this is a method of passive OAM (according to RFC 7799 classification of OAM performance measurement methods).
    -->

    <section title="Information Collection">
           <t>
               Several solutions (e.g., Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), YANG-based data models) are already in charge of collecting the statistics.
               That way, we can encapsulate these statistics in specific monitoring packets, to send them to the controller.
               </t>
           </section>

    
    
    <section title="Continuity Check">
		<t>
			We need to verify that two endpoints are connected.
            In other words, there exists "one" way to deliver the packets between
            two endpoints A and B.
 		</t>
        
        </section>

        
        <section title="Connectivity Verification">

		<t>
            Additionally, to the Continuity Check, we have to verify the connectivity.
            This verification considers additional constraints, i.e., the absence of
            misconnection.
        </t>
        <t>
            In particular, the resources have to be reserved by a given flow, and no
             packets from other flows steal the corresponding resources. Similarly, the
             destination does not receive packets from different flows through its interface.
            </t>
     
    
        <t>
			It is worth noting that the control and data packets may not follow the same
            path, and the connectivity verification has to be conducted in-band without
            impacting the data traffic.
            <!-- TODO-Greg-
            It is critical for both CC, CV and, in general, active OAM methods. I think it can be listed in the Requirements for OAM in RAW section.
            -->
            Test packets must share the fate with the monitored data traffic without introducing congestion in normal network conditions.
		</t>


	</section>
        
        
   
    <section title="Route Tracing">
		<t>
            <!-- TODO-Greg-
            Do we want to point to ICMP Ping specifically? Principles used in ICMP Ping/traceroute have been used in other networks, for example, MPLS LSP ping.
            -->
       		Ping and traceroute are two very common tools for diagnostic. 
       		<!-- GP: we may check with Pascal, if he agrees, we may introduce the concepts of Bitmap-->
       		They help to identify a subset of the list of routers in the route.
       		However, to be predictable, resources are reserved per flow in detnet.
       		Thus, we need to define route tracing tools able to track the route for a 
       		specific flow.
		</t>

        
        <t>
            Multipath routing can be considered to make the network fault-tolerant.
           In that way, each Maintenance Intermediate Endpoint has several possible next hops
            in the forwarding plane.
			Thus, all the possible paths between two maintenance endpoints should be 
			retrieved.
        </t>
    </section>

   
	<section title="Fault Verification/detection">
		<t>
      		detnet expects to operate fault-tolerant networks.
      		Thus, we need mechanisms able to detect faults, before they impact the network 
      		performance.
		</t>


		<t>
     		The network has to detect when a fault occurred, i.e., the network has deviated
             from its expected behavior.
     		While the network must report an alarm, the cause may not be identified 
     		precisely. 
     		For instance, the end-to-end reliability has decreased significantly, or a 
     		buffer overflow occurs.
		</t>

	</section>


	<section title="Fault Isolation/identification">
    	<t>
        	The network has isolated and identified the cause of the fault. 
        	For instance, the quality of a specific link has decreased, requiring more 
        	retransmissions, or the level of external interference has locally increased.
		</t>
	</section>
</section>



<!--    ADMINISTRATION          -->
<section title="Administration">
   
   <t>
      The network has to expose a collection of metrics to support an operator making proper decisions, including:
      
      <list style="symbols">
         
         <t>
            Queuing Delay: the time elapsed between a packet enqueued and its transmission to the next hop.
            </t>
         
         <t>
            Buffer occupancy: the number of packets present in the buffer, for each of the existing flows.
            </t>
         
      </list>
      </t>
   <t>
      These metrics should be collected:
      <list style="symbols">
         <t>
            per virtual circuit to measure the end-to-end performance for a given flow.
            Each of the paths has to be isolated in multipath routing strategies;
            </t>
         
         <t>
            per path to detect misbehaving path when multiple paths are applied.
            </t>
         
         <t>
            per device to detect misbehaving node, when it relays the packets of
            several flows.
            </t>
         </list>
   </t>
   
   
    <section title="Collection of metrics">
   
   
         <t>
             We have to minimize the number of statistics / measurements to exchange.
             Localized and centralized mechanisms have to be combined together, and
             additional control packets have to be triggered only after a fault detection.
         </t>
         
    
       </section>
         
   <section title="Worst-case metrics">
      <t>
         detnet aims to enable real-time communications on top of a heterogeneous architecture.
         To make correct decisions, the controller needs to know the distribution
         of packet losses/delays for each flow, and each hop of the paths.
         In other words, the average end-to-end statistics are not enough.
         They must allow the controller to predict the worst-case.

<!--   MAINTENANCE          -->

<!-- speak about predictive maintenance? -->

   <section title="Maintenance">
      <t>
         denet needs to implement a self-healing and self-optimization approach.
         The network must continuously retrieve the state of the network,
         to judge about the relevance of a reconfiguration, quantifying:
         <list>
            <t> the cost of the sub-optimality: resources may not be used
               optimally (e.g., a better path exists);
            </t>
            <t>
               the reconfiguration cost: the controller needs to trigger some
               reconfigurations.
               For this transient period, resources may be twice reserved, and control packets have to be transmitted.
            </t>
         </list>
         Thus, reconfiguration may only be triggered if the gain is significant.
         </t>
      
     
 <!-- TODO
     <t>
         TODO: OAM is the glue between the controller (e.g., SDN controller) and the wireless infrastructure.
         In other words, we need to maintain a very precise and configurable view of the network performances.
         
         </t>
      -->

      <section title="Multipath Routing">
           <t>
               To be fault-tolerant, several paths can be reserved between two maintenance
               endpoints. 
               They must be node-disjoint so that a path can be available at any time.
               </t>
           
           </section>
           
      <section title="Replication / Elimination">
          <t>
              When multiple paths are reserved between two maintenance endpoints,
              they may decide to replicate the packets to introduce redundancy, and
              thus to alleviate transmission errors and collisions. 
              For instance, in <xref target="fig_replication"/>, the source node S is 
              transmitting the packet to both parents, nodes A and B.              
              Each maintenance endpoint will decide to trigger the replication/elimination
              process when a set of metrics passes through a threshold value.

      <section title="Resource Reservation">
          <t>
            Because the QoS criteria associated with a path may degrade, the network has
            to provision additional resources along the path. We need to provide
            mechanisms to patch the network configuration.

      <section title="Soft transition after reconfiguration">
          <t>
              Since detnet expects to support real-time flows, we have to support soft-reconfiguration,
              where the novel resources are reserved before the ancient ones are released.
              Some mechanisms have to be proposed so that packets are forwarded through the
              novel track only when the resources are ready to be used, while maintaining
              the global state consistent (no packet reordering, duplication, etc.)

       <t>
           3 principles for high reliability:
           <list style="symbols">
           
               <t>
                   elimination of single points of failure
               </t>
               
               <t> reliable crossover: This is not treated explicitly but is tacit within 5.2. Internet
               Protocol executes the principle. The problem with this draft is it
               advocates adding state into the routing fabric without seeming to
               realize that that tends to defeat the reliable crossover principle. 5.3
               resource reservation clearly does this. Therefore, I recommend that the
               reliable crossover principle get explicit treatment at this stage so
               the tradeoffs can be properly weighed.
                 (We've gone through resource reservation protocols before - remember
               RSVP? - and they've not been very successful).

                   
                   </t>
           <t>detection of faults as they occur: 3.3 and 3.4 treat this, but, IMHO, the organization should again be
           cleaned up.  Back in the days when Simple Network Management Protocol
           was being worked up, a common acronym was FCAPS for [Fault Configuraion
           Accounting Performance Security]. Sounds to me like a pattern that this
           discussion could be mapped onto.
              In this case we have performance management solutions commingled
           with fault management ones. My experience is that QoS issues should
           always be the _last_ to be discussed, not the first.
              SNMP is nowhere mentioned in the draft. Sooner or later, you're
           going to need gets, sets and traps.  Is now the right time?
